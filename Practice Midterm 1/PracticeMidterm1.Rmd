# The Time Series plot shows the international arrivals (in thousands) to Australia from US
# There is a quarterly periodicity and spans from 1981Q1 - 2012Q3
# There seems to be a general upwards trend with many oscillations

quantile(ts)
mean(ts)

boxplot(ts, main="US Arrivals to Australia", xlab="US", ylab="Arrivals", col='lightblue')

# The data seems approximately centered without much skew

# Yes the time series is seasonal as there is a high seasonal decomposition

# The time series is additive

# Seasonal Indices
# s1: 6.784749
# s2: -7.969292
# s3: -4.717247
# s4: 5.901790

# Quarter 2 is low and Quarter 1 is high
# Quarter 2 might be low since thats a bad climate in Australia
# Quarter 1 might be high because people are traveling to warmer weather away from American winter since Q4 is also high

# Seasonally Adjusted time series
adj <- HoltWinters(ts, gamma=FALSE)
plot(adj)
# Yes seasonality has high fluctuations

# Naive
naive_forecast <- naive(ts, 4)
res <- residuals(naive_forecast)
plot(res)
# The residuals seem to be repeating indicating that there may be 
# an underlying component that naive isnt capturing

hist(res)
# The residuals appear normally distributed

# Plot residuals along with fitted line
plot(naive_forecast$fitted)
lines(naive_forecast$fitted + res, col="red")

# Plots residuals with actual values
plot(ts)
lines(ts + res, col="red")

Acf(res)
# There is a significant residual every even lag (2 quarters)

accuracy(naive_forecast)
plot(naive_forecast)
naive_forecast
# The accuracy is not very good, it has a MAPE of 12%
# It predicts the time series in 1 year will be 106.54
# One other observation is that it is stationary only
# Keeping the exact last recorded value without adjustments
