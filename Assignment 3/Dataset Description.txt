Dataset Description

This dataset records the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items for all months since 1947. The Consumer Price Index is the
price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers. Percent changes in the price index measure the inflation 
rate between any two time periods.

For this dataset, the CPI value represents the % value change in prices relative to the base of 1982-1984(CPI = 100).


Data Collection Methodology

This data is collected by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics every month. They collect it by recording the prices of various 
food, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation fares, service fees (e.g., water and sewer service), and sales taxes.

They collect the prices monthly from about 4,000 housing units and approximately 26,000 retail establishments across 87 urban areas,
before averaging them with weights representing their importance on spending for that particular group. The BLS, for this dataset,
has also seasonally adjusted the values, which removes the effects of seasonal changes such as weather, school year, production cycles,
and holidays.


Why This Dataset?

This dataset intrigues me because, in essence, it is the key metric for understanding how the cost for consumption has changed through
the years. I am interested to see if the change in CPI follows a more linear trend or is exponentially increasing.
