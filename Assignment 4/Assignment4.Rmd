Acf(timeseries) 
# time series shows strong correlation
# gradual trend downward instead of seasonal spike as well likely due to the 
# dataset already being seasonally adjusted

ts_decomp <- stl(timeseries, s.window = "periodic")
plot(ts_decomp)
# Shows an almost 1:1 pattern with Trend and Data
# Seasonality is oscillating rapidly which seems odd at first but makes sense
# When you see its range is inbetween -0.3 and and 0.1 (basically no effect)
# This is to be expected since it's a seasonally adjusted dataset

# Total Mean Forecast
mean_forecast <- meanf(timeseries, 12) 
mean_forecast # predicts the same number (254.49) for the next year
# the number is stationary because its just the mean off all points 
# in the data (post-2010 filter). Probably highly inaccurate because there is
# a clear upward trend in the data / not horizontal around mean

# Naive Forecast
naive_forecast <- naive(timeseries, 12)
naive_forecast
# The naive forecast just predicts the last available data point for the next
# 12 months (319.08). Not much else to add here

# Random Walk
rwf_forecast <- rwf(timeseries, 12, drift = TRUE)
rwf_forecast
# Random Walk behaves like the naive forecast except it adds on a trend
# variable to account for the increasing trend behavior in the data

# Seasonal Naive 
snaive_forecast <- snaive(timeseries, 12)
snaive_forecast
# Seasonal Naive is like RWF but instead of trend it accounts for seasonality
# The snaive forecast shows increasing from 311 on Feb 2025 to 316 in Nov 2025
# This is interesting because the dataset is seasonally adjusted so I wasn't 
# expecting a clear trend in this

# Moving Averages
MA_forecast <- ma(timeseries, order = 5)
# Moving average gives the average value of the 5 nearest points in the timeseries
plot(timeseries)
lines(MA_forecast, col = "pink")
# Plotting it shows it follows the actual values pretty closely which means the 
# data is more smooth / not very volatile

# Decomposition
f_stl <- forecast(ts_decomp, h=12)
f_stl
# This uses the decomposition from before to make forecast
# I expect it will mainly just follow the trend aspect since as we saw before
# the Seasonal variability was near 0 in the decomposition

# Holt Winters
hw <- HoltWinters(timeseries)
f_hw <- forecast(hw, h = 12)
hw #gives:
# alpha: 1
# beta : 0.20137
# gamma: 0.2014353
# Alpha is maxed value which shows all focus on most recent point with it decaying
# instantly to 0. Small beta and gamma factors
